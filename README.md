>My Personality type is:
>Commander(ENTJ-A)
As an ENTJ, I’m the kind of person who can’t just sit around waiting for things to happen, I make them happen. I see where things are headed, set big goals, and figure out the fastest way to get there. People tend to trust my confidence and follow my lead because I do what it takes to get the work done no matter how long it takes. I’m ambitious and won’t stop until I succeed. I’m good at pulling teams together, cutting through the noise, and turning ideas into reality. I think logically, make decisions fast and I always keep my eyes on the end goal.

As a technician for HP, I am counted on to make sound decisions. These decisions has to be in the context of improving my skill to provide a service to HP for repair and diagnosis for their product and also drive business profits.
