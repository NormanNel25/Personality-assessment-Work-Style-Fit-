>My Personality type is:
>Commander(ENTJ-A)
As an ENTJ, I’m the kind of person who can’t just sit around waiting for things to happen, I make them happen. I see where things are headed, set big goals, and figure out the fastest way to get there. People tend to trust my confidence and follow my lead because I do what it takes to get the work done no matter how long it takes. I’m ambitious and won’t stop until I succeed. I’m good at pulling teams together, cutting through the noise, and turning ideas into reality. I think logically, make decisions fast, and don’t get distracted—I always keep my eyes on the end goal
